## 1. About The Project
Initially developed as a freelance solution with the goal of enhancing member engagement, and fostering server interaction for a large Red Dead Redemption Online (RDO) community. JP Cripps aims to offer a variety of community-driven activities related to the RDO universe that enables members to participate in competitive, leaderboard-styled challenges. Additionally, JP Cripps streamlines administrative tasks, making it easier for server administrators to handle issues quickly and effectively.


## 2. Project Inspiration
The inspiration for the project was derived from a in-game PvP activity in which a group of players can engage with one another in an attempt to steal their wagon when riding out to a delivery. Originally created to track wagon thefts during in-game PvP activities, JP Cripps has evolved into a feature-rich bot that offers a variety of community-driven features enabling users to users to participate in challenges, track progress towards role milestones, and engage in competitive games centered around the Red Dead Redemption Online universe.
