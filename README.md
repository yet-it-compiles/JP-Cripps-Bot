## Project Inspiration
Initially developed as a freelance solution aimed at providing a fun, and competitive activity for a large Red Dead Redemption Online (RDO) community. The inspiration for the project was derived from a in-game PvP activity in which a group of players can engage with another in attempt to steal their wagon when riding out to a delivery. Originally created to track wagon thefts during in-game PvP activities, JP Cripps has evolved into a feature-rich bot that offers a variety of community-driven features enabling users to users to participate in challenges, track progress towards role milestones, and engage in competitive games centered around the Red Dead Redemption Online universe.
